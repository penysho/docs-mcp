# Requirements Document

## Introduction

現在のMCPサーバーのドキュメント更新機能は末尾への追記のみに対応しており、ドキュメント内の適切な箇所に内容を挿入することができません。この機能を改善し、ドキュメントの構造を理解して適切な位置に内容を挿入できる、汎用性と拡張性の高いシステムを開発します。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the MCP server, I want to insert content at semantically appropriate locations in a Google Docs document, so that the document maintains its logical structure and readability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies content to insert with semantic context THEN the system SHALL analyze the document structure and identify appropriate insertion points
2. WHEN multiple potential insertion points exist THEN the system SHALL provide options or use configurable rules to select the best location
3. WHEN the insertion would break document formatting THEN the system SHALL preserve existing formatting and apply appropriate formatting to new content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify insertion strategies (e.g., after specific headings, before conclusions, in specific sections), so that I can control where content gets placed in different types of documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies an insertion strategy THEN the system SHALL support multiple strategy types including heading-based, section-based, and pattern-based insertion
2. WHEN using heading-based insertion THEN the system SHALL locate headings by text match, level, or pattern and insert content in the appropriate position relative to the heading
3. WHEN using section-based insertion THEN the system SHALL identify document sections and insert content within the specified section
4. WHEN using pattern-based insertion THEN the system SHALL find text patterns and insert content relative to those patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully (missing sections, malformed documents, etc.), so that the insertion process is robust and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the specified insertion target is not found THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior options (end of document, beginning, or error)
2. WHEN the document structure is malformed or unexpected THEN the system SHALL log warnings and attempt best-effort insertion
3. WHEN insertion would create duplicate content THEN the system SHALL detect and prevent or warn about potential duplicates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preview where content will be inserted before making changes, so that I can verify the insertion location is correct.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a preview mode is requested THEN the system SHALL return the proposed insertion location without making actual changes
2. WHEN showing preview information THEN the system SHALL include context around the insertion point (surrounding text)
3. WHEN multiple insertion points are possible THEN the system SHALL show all potential locations with ranking or scoring

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the insertion system to be extensible, so that new insertion strategies can be added without modifying core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the system THEN it SHALL use a plugin-based architecture for insertion strategies
2. WHEN adding new insertion strategies THEN they SHALL implement a common interface without requiring changes to existing code
3. WHEN configuring insertion behavior THEN the system SHALL support strategy-specific configuration parameters

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed logging and error reporting for insertion operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues and understand what happened during insertion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing insertion operations THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about document analysis, strategy selection, and insertion results
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating what went wrong and potential solutions
3. WHEN insertion is successful THEN the system SHALL report the final insertion location and any modifications made to the content
